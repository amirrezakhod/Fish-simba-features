Lionfish Feature-Extraction Demo (SimBA)

This short README walks you through running our custom feature-extraction script on an 11-second lionfish video that has already been tracked with DeepLabCut.

1. Install SimBA
Follow the official installation guide at https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba.

2. Open the project
Change your working directory to the folder that contains project_folder/, then launch SimBA and load the configuration file:
Lionfish_feature_extraction_code/Simba_config/project_folder/project_config.ini

3. Select the custom extractor
In SimBAâ€™s Extract Features menu choose Apply user-defined feature extraction, then point SimBA to:
Lionfish_feature_extraction_code/Feature_extraction_file/lionfish_feature_extraction.py

4. Run extraction
Start the extraction. The resulting CSV will be written to:
Lionfish_feature_extraction_code/Simba_config/project_folder/csv/features_extracted/


The script calculates a large suite of kinematic and behavioural features. To streamline model building you can exclude or include specific metrics without touching any other code:
Users may customize which features are extracted by specifying either the included_features or excluded_features parameters. These parameters should reference feature names defined in the AVAILABLE_FEATURES list:

Use included_features to extract only the specified features.

Use excluded_features to extract all features except those listed.

If neither parameter is specified, the extractor defaults to computing all features in AVAILABLE_FEATURES.

Researchers with minimal coding experience can simply edit the lists to fine-tune the feature set for their species and behaviour of interest.
